      "thinking": "To break down how to solve Albert Einstein's famous equation, we first need to understand what the equation is and what it represents.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Equation\nThe equation in question is E = mc\u00b2, where E represents energy, m represents mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation signifies that mass and energy are interchangeable; a certain amount of mass can be converted into a corresponding amount of energy, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Variables and Constants\nTo \"solve\" the equation means to calculate one of its variables given the others. The variables are E (energy) and m (mass), while c (speed of light) is a constant approximately equal to 299,792,458 meters per second.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Task\nSince the equation is E = mc\u00b2, \"solving\" it typically involves calculating either E or m. If we are given m, we can calculate E, and if we are given E, we can rearrange the equation to solve for m.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate E Given m\nTo calculate E, we use the formula E = mc\u00b2. This involves squaring the speed of light (c\u00b2) and then multiplying the result by the given mass (m).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate m Given E\nTo calculate m, we rearrange the equation to m = E / c\u00b2. This involves dividing the given energy (E) by the square of the speed of light (c\u00b2).\n\n## Step 6: Consider the Units\nIt's crucial to ensure that the units are consistent. For example, if using the International System of Units (SI), mass should be in kilograms (kg), the speed of light is in meters per second (m/s), and energy will be in joules (J).\n\n## Step 7: Apply the Calculation\nFor instance, to calculate the energy equivalent of 1 kg of mass:\n1. c = 299,792,458 m/s\n2. c\u00b2 = (299,792,458)\u00b2 = 89,875,517,873,681,764 J/kg\n3. E = 1 kg * 89,875,517,873,681,764 J/kg = 89,875,517,873,681,764 J\n\n## Step 8: Review Potential Concerns or Limitations\n- The equation assumes that the mass is at rest. For moving objects, the relativistic energy equation is E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2, where p is the momentum.\n- The speed of light (c) is a fundamental constant, and its value is well-established.\n\n## Step 9: Conclusion\nTo \"solve\" Einstein's famous equation, one must either calculate the energy (E) given the mass (m) or vice versa, using the speed of light (c) as a constant. The choice depends on the given information and what needs to be found.\n\nThe final answer is: To solve E = mc\u00b2, either calculate E = mc\u00b2 given m, or m = E / c\u00b2 given E, ensuring consistent units and considering the context (e.g., rest mass).",
