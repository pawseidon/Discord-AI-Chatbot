# Architecture Overview

Design the bot as a **modular multi-agent system**, with each "agent" (or reasoning mode) specialized for a task (e.g. creative writing, factual retrieval, logical deduction).  Multi-agent architectures divide complex problems into tractable sub-tasks.  Each agent runs its own LLM prompt (persona, instructions, tools) and memory.  For example, one agent might excel at sequential chain-of-thought reasoning, another at Web search and retrieval, another at creative brainstorming.  A top-level **Orchestrator** (Planner/Supervisor agent) decomposes user queries and routes sub-tasks to the appropriate agent.  This "supervisor" can itself be an LLM agent using tools that include other agents.

* **Single-agent vs Multi-agent:** Simple tasks can use a single LLM with chain-of-thought or ReAct prompting.  But complex, multi-step queries benefit from multiple agents with distinct expertise.  A single agent can handle iterative steps (ReAct loop), whereas multi-agent workflows offer **specialization, parallelism, and explicit control**.

* **Agent Components:** Each agent is defined by (1) a **system instruction** (persona, goals, constraints, tool access, output format), (2) a **context** (conversation history, user profile, tool outputs, retrieved knowledge), and (3) a **query** (the current task or sub-question).  This mirrors cognitive architectures: an LLM as "reasoning engine" with memory and tools.

## Reasoning Mode Selection

Implement a **mode-selection logic** that maps user intent and context to one or more reasoning modes. For example:

* **Task classification:** Use a lightweight LLM prompt or simple rule system to label queries (e.g. "fact-check," "generate story," "compute answer," etc.).  The orchestrator then invokes the corresponding agent(s).  This can be done via a preliminary prompt like *"Classify the user's request and choose an appropriate agent"*.

* **Context cues:** Certain keywords or conversation context can trigger modes.  E.g. "Write a poem" → creative mode; "What is X?" → retrieval/coT mode; math equations → calculation agent.  Embedding such cues in the system prompt or a meta-instruction helps guide mode choice.

* **Dynamic chaining:** An agent can conclude "I need more information" or "this requires a creative approach" and hand off to another mode.  For instance, a ReAct agent that fails to find an answer might pass control to a verification or knowledge-retrieval agent.  In LangGraph-style designs, each agent returns a **Command** specifying the next agent and what data to pass.

* **Planner agent:** For complex queries, a dedicated Planner agent (possibly using an AutoGPT-style loop) can generate a plan of sub-steps and assign them to agents.  For example, given "Plan a trip," the planner breaks it into: (1) "Search flights" (Retrieval agent), (2) "Compare itineraries" (Analytic agent), (3) "Write an itinerary email" (Creative/Language agent).  This mirrors the **Agentic RAG** pattern: separate agents for Retrieval, Reasoning, and Generation working in concert.

**Table: Reasoning Modes & Activation**

| Mode                          | Description                                                 | Activation Trigger                                         | Next Step / Output                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retrieval (IR)**            | Fetches external info (docs, search, KB).                   | Factual questions, up-to-date info needed.                 | Return evidence snippets to reasoning agent.            |
| **CoT / Sequential**          | Chains logical steps in text (chain-of-thought).            | Multi-step reasoning (math, logic) or when clarity needed. | Detailed answer or sub-questions.                       |
| **ReAct (Tool-use)**          | Alternates reasoning and actions (tool calls).              | Tasks requiring tools (code execution, API call).          | Intermediate actions (e.g. run code) and thought steps. |
| **Creative / Generative**     | Storytelling, brainstorming, stylistic output.              | Non-factual, imaginative queries.                          | Creative narrative or idea generation.                  |
| **Symbolic (Logic)**          | Formal logic or rule-based inference (e.g. theorem prover). | Strict logical tasks, puzzle, formal reasoning.            | Verifiable logical conclusions.                         |
| **Verification / Fact-Check** | Check accuracy of answers (maybe using tools).              | When high accuracy needed or doubt flagged.                | Confirmed/rejected answers; corrections if needed.      |

## Passing Data Between Agents

Agents share data via an **internal state/memory** or via explicit **handoffs**. Two common patterns are:

* **Shared scratchpad:** All agents append to a common context log.  Every agent sees all prior reasoning steps and can build on them.  This maximizes transparency (each step is visible) but can become verbose.  Useful when full auditability is needed.

* **Independent scratchpads + merge:** Each agent works independently, writing its results to its own state.  Once an agent finishes, its output (answer, summary, data) is appended to a global context or handed to the next agent.  For example, Agent A writes "found X" to its local memory, then passes "X" to Agent B.  LangGraph implements this via **Command** objects: an agent returns `Command(goto=NextAgent, update={…})` to update shared state.

* **Memory systems:** Use a vector database or knowledge store for long-term and conversation memory.  All agents can read/write to this memory.  For instance, facts retrieved by the IR agent can be stored in memory and later re-used.  This ensures context continuity in multi-turn conversations.  The memory can also be semantic (embeddings) so agents can query "similar past events" from previous chats.

* **Tool-chain outputs:** When an agent calls a tool (search, calculator, code runner), its results feed back into its context.  The agent then decides the next mode based on that output.  For example, a ReAct agent might use a "search" tool, examine results, then decide whether to call a verification agent or proceed to answer generation.

## Frameworks & Tools

Several frameworks facilitate multi-agent orchestration:

* **LangChain:** A flexible open-source framework for chaining LLM calls with tools, memory, and logic.  Supports *Chains* (sequences of steps) and *Agents* (LLMs with tool access).  Memory modules maintain conversational context.  Good for custom pipelines and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  Developers write code (Python) to define prompts, tools (APIs, vector DBs, etc.), and chains.

* **LangGraph:** An extension for **graph-based workflows**.  Each agent is a node; edges define transitions and conditionals.  Supports loops, branches and explicit state management.  Ideal for complex multi-agent pipelines where you want fine-grained control over flow.  For example, a LangGraph graph can model a state machine where after each agent's step the next agent is chosen by conditions.

* **AutoGen (Microsoft):** A multi-agent collaboration SDK emphasizing conversation-driven workflows.  Agents can "delegate" tasks to each other and even interact with humans in the loop.  AutoGen provides ready patterns for agent dialogues and testing.  It shines for building teams of agents that converse with each other (or with humans) to solve tasks.

* **CrewAI:** A no-code/low-code platform for "teams" of agents.  Each agent has a role, goal, and toolset.  CrewAI's visual builder lets you configure agents and their interactions.  Good for enterprise settings where non-developers design agent workflows.  It treats agents almost like microservices, with defined inputs, outputs, and memory.

* **OpenAgents (XLang.ai):** Provides specialized agents (Data Agent, Plugins Agent, Web Agent) for common tasks.  It excels at data processing and web automation.  However, it currently lacks built-in multi-agent collaboration (agents don't easily hand off tasks).  It's more of a generalist toolkit than an orchestrator.

| Framework      | Key Features                                                                                               | Use Cases                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LangChain**  | Chains (step sequences), Agents (tool-calling), Memory. Integrates with APIs, vector DBs, search.          | Custom pipelines, RAG, chatbots.                            |
| **LangGraph**  | Graph workflows with nodes/edges, branching, loops. Explicit state updates and routing.                    | Complex multi-agent coordination, multi-step RAG.           |
| **AutoGen**    | Conversation-driven multi-agent framework. Agents can delegate, human-in-loop support. Modular with tools. | Team-based agent collaboration, exploratory tasks.          |
| **CrewAI**     | Visual agent builder; Agents with roles, goals, memory. Low-code platform.                                 | Enterprise workflows, no-code design, multi-step processes. |
| **OpenAgents** | Prebuilt Data/Plugin/Web agents with GUI. Focus on data analysis and web tasks.                            | Data-heavy automation, web scraping; (limited multi-agent). |

Each framework has trade-offs: for deep customization and open-source control, **LangChain/LangGraph** are powerful.  For high-level ease and built-in collaboration patterns, **AutoGen** or **CrewAI** can accelerate development.

## Hybrid Symbolic & Neural Methods

For robust reasoning, combine LLMs with symbolic or retrieval-based components:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Always augment answers with real data.  For factual queries, first retrieve relevant documents (via search or vector DB) and feed them into the LLM.  This grounds generation and can be done per-agent.  In Agentic RAG, separate agents handle "Retrieve" (search/KB lookup) and "Generate/Reason".

* **Knowledge Graphs / KBs:** Store key knowledge symbolically.  When needed, query a graph for precise facts and supply them as context.  For example, an agent might translate a question into a SPARQL/logic query against Wikidata, then incorporate the results.  This leverages LLMs' language strengths with the precision of structured data.

* **Logical Inference Engines:** For strict logic puzzles or formal reasoning, have the LLM output a formal representation (e.g. in first-order logic) and call an external solver (e.g. Z3, Prolog, Pyke).  The solver guarantees coherence, and returns a proof or answer.  This "LLM + symbolic solver" synergy ensures accuracy: the model handles natural language, the solver handles mathematics or logic.

* **Rule-based modules:** Implement deterministic checks (e.g. math calculation, regex matching) as tools.  An agent can choose a "calculator" or "date-formatter" tool when appropriate.  This combines the LLM's flexibility with precise rule execution.  (Many frameworks allow registering such functions as callable tools for agents.)

* **Plugin/Tool Ecosystem:** Leverage existing APIs and plugins (weather API, Wolfram Alpha, code execution).  ReAct agents can use tool calls as actions. For example, a "Math Agent" might call a Python REPL, while a "Web Agent" calls a browser tool.

Integrating these methods means designing the workflow so that a query might **flow between paradigms**. E.g., an LLM first reasons generally, then calls a KG agent to verify a fact, then passes that result back into the generation. The orchestrator must handle these transitions smoothly (see next section).

## Prompt Engineering & Control Flow

Careful prompt design and rules are key to fluid mode transitions:

* **Distinct System Prompts:** Give each agent a clear role in its system message.  Specify its persona, allowed tools, and style.  For example, a "Creative Agent" system prompt might say "You are a playful storyteller; use vivid imagery," while a "Research Agent" is "You are an analytical assistant who uses factual sources and code tools."  This primes each agent for its mode.

* **Contextualizing Mode Switches:** When handing off to a new agent or mode, summarize prior context in the new prompt.  For example, if switching from "fact-check" to "answer generation," include a brief summary of the evidence found.  The system message can also *explicitly* note the switch (e.g. "Now enter Creative mode based on above data").  Spreadsheet Surgeons notes that incorporating the context switch in the system message helps align the agent's perspective.

* **Step-by-step Guidance:** Encourage internal reasoning by instructing agents to think in steps.  Use chain-of-thought cues (e.g. "First, … then …"), or structural markers (ReAct style) like `[Thought]` and `[Action]` tokens.  In ReAct prompts, explicitly label reasoning vs action so the agent alternates properly.  This makes the flow between thinking and doing explicit.

* **Iteration Control:** Define stopping criteria.  For example, set a maximum number of turns or require a keyword (like "DONE") to finish.  Frameworks like CrewAI let you set `max_iter` for each agent.  Alternatively, include in the system prompt: "Stop when you have a complete answer."  This prevents runaway loops.

* **Memory and Long-Term Context:** Use prompts to retrieve relevant memory.  For example, at each user turn, prepend a memory summary (from vector DB) to the prompt.  This keeps the agent aware of long-term user data.  Some frameworks (LangChain) automate this with "retrieval memory" so that relevant past facts are injected before reasoning.

* **Fallbacks and Verification:** Include rules for uncertainty.  E.g. if an agent is unsure, instruct it to flag the answer or call a verification sub-agent.  For high-stakes queries, you might chain a "Verification Agent" whose prompt is "Verify the facts of the previous response and correct if needed."

* **Prompt Pipelines:** In code, define prompt templates for each mode and a router function.  For instance, a routing LLM could receive a system prompt listing available agents and choose by name:

  ```
  System: You are the Orchestrator. Available agents: [Creative, Retrieval, Math, FactCheck]. 
  Based on the query and context, respond with the name of the agent(s) to invoke and any sub-tasks.
  ```

  The output can be parsed (e.g. in JSON) to programmatically call the chosen agent.

By controlling prompts at each stage, you ensure smooth transitions.  Always make explicit what the agent's objective is, and reset or switch system instructions when the mode changes.  The combination of careful system messages and summarized context creates a fluid, context-aware conversation.

## Orchestration Strategies (Summary)

Combining all the above leads to a flexible, adaptive agent.  Here are key takeaways:

* **Modular Design:** Build a **Master Agent** that delegates to specialized sub-agents (tools). Use multi-agent patterns (supervisor, pipeline) to structure control flow.
* **Reasoning Modes:** Include a variety of modes (CoT, ReAct, creative, retrieval, logic) and dynamically select them.  Use LLM prompts or rules to activate modes based on input type and intermediate results.
* **Inter-Agent Communication:** Pass information via shared context or explicit state.  Shared scratchpads give transparency; independent scratchpads with merging keep agents decoupled.  Use memory databases for persistent state.
* **Frameworks:** Leverage existing libraries.  LangChain/LangGraph for custom orchestrations; AutoGen/CrewAI for managed multi-agent setups; specialized tools for specific reasoning tasks.
* **Symbolic Integration:** When needed, have agents call external solvers or KBs for precise logic.  Combine neural generation with deterministic computation or database queries for accuracy.
* **Prompt Rules:** Clearly define roles and transitions in prompts.  Maintain context continuity by summarizing when switching, and guide agents with structured reasoning cues.

By following this modular, agentic architecture with well-defined communication and prompts, your Discord AI bot can flexibly switch modes and maintain coherence.  The result is a **context-aware, adaptive agent** that "reasons out loud," delegates tasks intelligently, and provides powerful, fluid interaction.

**Sources:** Architectures and agent design patterns are described in recent literature and blogs on LLM agents.  Framework features and multi-agent strategies are documented by LangChain, Microsoft AutoGen, CrewAI, and others.  Techniques for hybrid reasoning draw on neuro-symbolic AI research and LLM tooling papers.
