# Multi-Agent Discord Bot: Architecture & Implementation Guide

Building an intelligent Discord bot with **modular reasoning agents** involves decomposing tasks into specialized workflows. A typical architecture includes: (a) a **query classifier/router** that detects the user’s intent and chooses appropriate reasoning modes, (b) a **central orchestrator or planner agent** that sequences subtasks or hands off work, (c) several **worker agents** (e.g. sequential/chain-of-thought agent, RAG agent, creative agent, verification agent, graph agent, etc.), (d) a **shared state and memory** store (e.g. in-memory scratchpads and vector DB), and (e) **external tool connectors** (search APIs, calculators, knowledge bases). Each agent is a self-contained LLM-based component with a defined role.  High-level modularity (specialized agents focusing on narrow tasks) improves maintainability and performance.

## Agent Types & Reasoning Modes

Common specialized agents include:

* **Router/Classifier Agent**:  Runs first on each query to detect intent or domain (e.g. via keyword matching or a small LLM classifier). Routes the query to the right workflow (e.g. RAG vs creative vs math). You may implement it as a lightweight rule-based check or a tiny model.
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented) Agent**:  Handles fact-based questions. It performs a vector‐ or keyword‐based lookup in an indexed knowledge base (e.g. Qdrant, Pinecone, or Google search API) and synthesizes answers. Use embeddings and a retrieval chain for context, then prompt an LLM to generate a response grounded on retrieved docs.
* **Sequential/Logic Agent**:  Performs **step-by-step reasoning** (e.g. chain-of-thought) on multi-step tasks (like planning, coding, math). It may maintain an internal *scratchpad* of steps or intermediate data. For example, it could call a math library or planning tool at each step, then feed intermediate results back into the prompt.
* **Creative/Generative Agent**:  Produces imaginative or open-ended content (stories, analogies, marketing copy). It typically uses a high-temperature LLM prompt optimized for creativity and may ignore strict factual checks.
* **Verification/Fact-Check Agent**:  Takes an answer (or partial answer) from another agent and **cross-checks facts** or consistency. It might re-query data sources or logic-check outputs. For instance, it could run a query against Wikipedia or do a vector search of key phrases to verify accuracy. If confidence is low, this agent can flag or correct the answer.
* **Graph/Structured Data Agent**:  Works with structured knowledge (e.g. knowledge graphs, SQL databases, or network analysis). It may translate queries into graph algorithms or database queries and interpret results.
* **Tool Agent**:  Invokes external code or APIs (calculators, weather API, translation service, etc.) when needed. Can be implemented as a “tool” callable by other agents.

Each agent should have a clear prompt persona (system message) and supported tools. For example, a Verification Agent’s system prompt might be: “You are a diligent fact-checker. Verify factual claims and provide sources.” Then, other agents can hand off answers to it.  In general, agents correspond to **focused workflows**: each agent with its own prompt, LLM, and tools.

## Workflow Orchestration Patterns

The agents interact via a **controller** or workflow. Two common patterns are:

* **Supervisor/Planner Architecture**: A central *supervisor agent* (or planning module) oversees the flow. It takes the user query (and possibly interim results) and decides which agent to invoke next. The supervisor can be an LLM with a system prompt like “You are a task planner. Decide which specialist agent handles each step.” It may explicitly instruct which agent to call and pass payload. This pattern gives clear control flow and easy error handling, but adds overhead of supervision. LangChain’s LangGraph, for instance, supports supervisor nodes that route tasks to sub-agents.

* **Networked/Chained Agents**: Agents can also be connected in a directed graph or pipeline. For example, one agent’s output feeds as input to the next (possibly multiple times). LangGraph visualizes agents as nodes in a graph, using `Command` outputs to route between them. In a simple pipeline, the RAG agent might run first, then pass its answer to the Verification agent. In more complex loops, agents may collaborate on a **shared scratchpad** of text or data. Shared memory means all agents see each step of reasoning (verbose, but fully transparent), whereas independent scratchpads keep each agent’s context isolated and only combine final answers.

**Orchestration examples**:

* **Linear Pipeline** (Router → RAG → Verification → Response). The router picks RAG mode, RAG agent retrieves docs and answers, then Verification re-checks facts, and final answer is returned.
* **Iterative Loop** (Sequential agent asks Verification questions, then loops back to refine the answer until a stopping criterion is met).
* **Parallel Experts** (Multiple agents work independently, and a aggregator agent or vote reconciles their outputs).
* **Hierarchical Teams**: A supervisor might spawn sub-supervisors for complex tasks (e.g. a project manager agent dividing tasks among research/writer subagents).

Whatever pattern, **handoffs** between agents include a designated “next agent” and the shared payload (context, scratchpad, or message list). For example, an agent may return a command like `goto='verification_agent'` with the current answer as payload, prompting the orchestrator to invoke the Verification agent next.

## Inter-Agent Communication & State Management

Agents communicate by passing structured state or messages. Key approaches include:

* **Shared State Graph**: Use a framework (e.g. LangGraph) that maintains a central `State` object (often a dict) with conversation history, intermediate results, and flags. Each agent reads/writes to this state. LangGraph’s state graph persists *thread-scoped state* between steps, so context flows automatically. You can checkpoint state to resume if needed.
* **Message Passing**: Agents exchange messages via a message bus or direct function calls. For example, the router returns a Python object indicating “call RAG agent with these inputs”. That agent returns output which is fed to the next. Use Python’s asyncio queues or callback functions for asynchronous flows. LangChain’s `Command` objects can encode a handoff to another node.
* **Conversation Memory**: Maintain a history of the Discord thread (e.g. last N user and bot messages) in memory (buffer, vector store, or database). This short-term memory ensures continuity. Additionally, implement **long-term memory** by storing key facts in a vector DB (e.g. user preferences or past Q\&A) that retrieval can use. For instance, store each user’s profile or persistent info as embeddings; agents can query this store to personalize responses.
* **Agent-Specific Scratchpads**: Each agent might hold a private scratchpad (internal workspace) for its own chain-of-thought. These aren’t directly shared except via the orchestrator. This prevents noisy logs but requires the orchestrator to merge final answers into the global conversation.

In practice, a **vector database** (Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma) often serves as shared memory for document context and long-term facts. The bot’s code would write relevant data (e.g. knowledge triples, summaries) to it and retrieve on each query. For short-term conversational memory, one can simply keep the recent message history in the state object.

## Error Handling, Confidence & Fallbacks

Robust agents must detect and recover from uncertainty or failures. Key strategies:

* **Confidence Scoring**: After an LLM response, use a secondary check (another model or rule) to estimate confidence. For example, prompt the agent to output a confidence (0–1) with each answer. If confidence < threshold (e.g. 0.7), trigger fallback logic (ask user to clarify or route differently).
* **Fallback Agents/Nodes**: Design explicit *fallback paths*. For instance, if a Verification agent finds errors, or if an LLM fails (timeout, exception, or garbled output), route to a **Fallback Agent** that can either ask for clarification (“I’m not sure, could you rephrase?”) or provide a safe generic answer. As noted in multi-agent graphs, you can include *fallback nodes* that catch failures and re-route.
* **Redundant Checks**: Implement *redundancy*: have two agents independently answer a critical question, then a comparison agent cross-validates them. Discrepancies trigger further checks.
* **User Clarification Loops**: If intent is ambiguous or answer uncertain, proactively ask the user to clarify or break down the question. This keeps the bot from hallucinating.
* **Graceful Degradation**: On external API errors or timeouts, have a default safe response (e.g. “Sorry, I couldn’t fetch that info right now.”) and log the incident.
* **Monitoring & Logging**: Track agent performance (e.g. via LangSmith or custom logs). Log agent outputs, confidence, and fallback triggers to identify failure modes.

By combining confidence thresholds with fallback paths, the system avoids propagating errors. For example: *“If the Verification agent cannot confirm the RAG answer, it returns a `goto='fallback_agent'` command instead of the final answer”*.

## Frameworks & Libraries

Choosing a framework helps manage complexity. Notable Python frameworks for multi-agent workflows include:

| Framework                                                                                                  | Key Features                                                                                                                          | Notes                                                                                        |

| **LangChain (LangGraph)**                                                                                  | Graph-based multi-agent flows, built-in memory, integration with LangSmith for monitoring, support for custom state graphs and tools. | Good for explicit agent graphs; some memory quirks reported.                                 |
| **Microsoft AutoGen**                                                                                      | Chat-based multi-agent system, dynamic orchestration, tool and memory integration, allows complex async chat between agents.          | Procedural coding style (no built-in graph DSL), strong for custom flows, good tool support. |
| **CrewAI**                                                                                                 | Agent/task abstraction (Agent, Crew, Task), built-in state management and memory concepts, good for concurrency.                      | Seamless coordination; logging can be tricky.                                                |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK**                                                                                      | Lightweight orchestration primitives, supports planner/executor paradigm.                                                             | In early stages; useful for simple multi-agent patterns.                                     |
| **Simple frameworks**:   Or use custom orchestration (e.g. `asyncio`, `celery`) if you prefer flexibility. |                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                              |

LangGraph (LangChain) provides a high-level DAG abstraction (nodes = agents, edges = handoffs) and handles short/long-term memory. AutoGen is another popular choice for building teams of chat agents (it uses OpenAI chat models under the hood). CrewAI offers an out-of-the-box task framework but has different abstractions (Agents/Crews). The best choice depends on your needs – e.g., LangGraph is great if you want visualizable workflows, while AutoGen might offer lower-level control.

## Prompt Engineering & Transitions

Well-crafted prompts ensure agents stay in role and coordinate smoothly:

* **Role & Task Clarity**: Each agent’s system prompt should clearly define its expertise and instructions. For example: *“You are a MathExpert agent. Solve math problems step-by-step, show your work.”* Use few-shot examples if needed.
* **Consistent Persona**: If multiple agents “talk”, design a format for message passing (e.g. JSON with `agent_name`, `content`). This prevents confusion.
* **Handoff Phrasing**: In prompts, explicitly reference other agents by name if needed. E.g. “Consult the Verifier agent on this fact.” The orchestrator code will handle the actual call.
* **Chain-of-Thought Tags**: In some cases, you may have an agent output its reasoning (for the next agent) vs just the final answer (for user). Mark outputs distinctly (e.g. “ANALYSIS:” vs “ANSWER:”). Then the next agent can parse accordingly.
* **Guardrails in Prompts**: Include instructions to validate outputs (e.g. “If you are not confident, say 'UNCERTAIN'” or give a confidence score).
* **Context Forwarding**: Make sure each agent’s prompt includes relevant context: the original user query plus any retrieved docs or prior scratchpad content. Prompt templates can assemble this.
* **Output Format**: Standardize how agents return answers (e.g. JSON or specific delimiters) so the orchestrator can parse and pass outputs cleanly to other agents or back to the user.

By carefully engineering prompts, you ensure the transition between agents is smooth and coherent. For example, after the RAG agent answers, the orchestrator can call the Verification agent with a prompt like: *“Verify the following answer is correct: \[RAG answer]. Provide reasons.”*

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define Agents & Workflows**: List all reasoning modes and their agents. For each, decide what tools/APIs it needs (vector DB, search API, calculator library, etc.), and draft its system/user prompts.
2. **Build Core Modules**:

   * **Classifier/Router**: Implement keyword rules or a small LLM (or multi-class classifier) to map queries to modes.
   * **Memory Infrastructure**: Set up a conversation state store (in-memory or DB) and a vector store for RAG/long-term memory. Ingest any domain knowledge into the vector DB.
3. **Choose Orchestration Framework**: Use LangGraph/AutoGen (or custom `asyncio` logic) to implement the control flow. E.g., build a LangGraph `StateGraph` where nodes are agent functions. Incorporate a supervisor node if using that pattern.
4. **Implement Agents**: Code each agent as a function or object: it takes input (state/context), constructs a prompt, calls the LLM or tool, then returns output (and any `goto=` for next agent). Test them individually.
5. **Inter-Agent Communication**: Use LangGraph Commands or a custom message protocol to hand off between agents. Ensure state (scratchpad) is passed along. Use JSON or Python dicts for clarity.
6. **Integrate with Discord**: In your `discord.py` event handler, feed user messages into the orchestrator. The orchestrator yields a final answer (and updated state). Send the answer back to Discord, managing message length (split if >2000 chars).
7. **Asynchronous Tasks**: Ensure heavy tasks (LLM calls, searches) run asynchronously (`await`). Discord’s event loop can spawn background tasks if needed (`asyncio.create_task`). Use proper locks if agents share state.
8. **Add Confidence/Fallback Logic**: Wrap agent calls with try/catch. After each major step, check confidence or output validity. If criteria fail, trigger the fallback path instead of normal flow.
9. **Testing & Iteration**: Run end-to-end tests on sample queries. Check how the bot chooses modes, how agents pass data, and that memory is used. Refine prompts and thresholds.
10. **Monitoring**: (Optional) Integrate LangSmith or a logging system to capture agent calls, decisions, and anomalies for debugging.

## Agent Message Passing (Example Table)

| **Agent**     | **Role/Task**                           | **Input/Output**                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router        | Detect query type (RAG vs math vs etc.) | In: User message<br>Out: Decision token (e.g. `mode="RAG"`)                        |
| RAG Agent     | Retrieve & answer factual queries       | In: Query text, maybe user history<br>Out: Answer text, sources, confidence        |
| SeqAgent      | Stepwise logic (calcs/plans)            | In: Query or subtask, context state<br>Out: Step-by-step reasoning + result        |
| CreativeAgent | Generate open-ended responses           | In: Query/theme<br>Out: Creative content (e.g. story, analogy)                     |
| VerifyAgent   | Fact-check an answer                    | In: Answer text<br>Out: Verdict (correct/incorrect), corrections, confidence       |
| FallbackAgent | Handle errors or unclear cases          | In: Failure reason or raw query<br>Out: Clarifying question or safe default answer |

Each arrow between agents is managed by your orchestrator code. For example, after the RAG Agent outputs an answer, the orchestrator passes that answer as input to the VerifyAgent (if in the workflow), before finally posting back to the user.

## Integration Tips

* **Memory**: Use vector searches to recall relevant past info or knowledge. For example, on each query embed the user message and retrieve similar past queries/answers to inform the response. Libraries like LangChain make this easy.
* **Tools**: Expose tools (Python functions, APIs) to LLMs via function-calling or explicit prompts. E.g. a math tool can be exposed so a reasoning agent can say “CALL\_MATH\_TOOL: \[expression]” and your code executes it.
* **APIs**: For up-to-date data (news, weather), call external APIs inside agents. Ensure to handle rate limits and errors.
* **Scalability**: If many users, consider pooling LLM clients or parallelizing independent tasks. Frameworks like **Celery** or cloud functions can help scale background tasks (though Discord bots often run on a single process).
* **Latency**: Optimize for speed by pre-loading LLMs, caching common queries, and keeping prompts concise. Use streaming where possible to start sending partial Discord replies early (with caution).
* **Security**: Sanitize any user inputs before passing to tools. For example, if executing code, run in a restricted environment.

## Conclusion

By combining specialized LLM agents under a clear orchestration scheme, your Discord bot can handle complex queries flexibly. Use **supervisor or graph patterns** to define how agents route tasks, maintain both short-term and long-term memory, and implement robust fallback logic. Frameworks like LangGraph or AutoGen can jump-start this architecture, providing structure for multi-agent flows. With well-engineered prompts and state management, the bot will dynamically choose the right reasoning mode and smoothly hand off subtasks – transforming it from an “amateur” to a confident, context-aware agent-based system.

**Sources:** Core concepts and examples are drawn from LangChain/ LangGraph docs and related multi-agent system literature, as well as practical tutorials on agentic RAG Discord bots.
# Architecture Overview



Design the bot as a **modular multi-agent system**, with each "agent" (or reasoning mode) specialized for a task (e.g. creative writing, factual retrieval, logical deduction).  Multi-agent architectures divide complex problems into tractable sub-tasks.  Each agent runs its own LLM prompt (persona, instructions, tools) and memory.  For example, one agent might excel at sequential chain-of-thought reasoning, another at Web search and retrieval, another at creative brainstorming.  A top-level **Orchestrator** (Planner/Supervisor agent) decomposes user queries and routes sub-tasks to the appropriate agent.  This "supervisor" can itself be an LLM agent using tools that include other agents.

* **Single-agent vs Multi-agent:** Simple tasks can use a single LLM with chain-of-thought or ReAct prompting.  But complex, multi-step queries benefit from multiple agents with distinct expertise.  A single agent can handle iterative steps (ReAct loop), whereas multi-agent workflows offer **specialization, parallelism, and explicit control**.

* **Agent Components:** Each agent is defined by (1) a **system instruction** (persona, goals, constraints, tool access, output format), (2) a **context** (conversation history, user profile, tool outputs, retrieved knowledge), and (3) a **query** (the current task or sub-question).  This mirrors cognitive architectures: an LLM as "reasoning engine" with memory and tools.

## Reasoning Mode Selection

Implement a **mode-selection logic** that maps user intent and context to one or more reasoning modes. For example:

* **Task classification:** Use a lightweight LLM prompt or simple rule system to label queries (e.g. "fact-check," "generate story," "compute answer," etc.).  The orchestrator then invokes the corresponding agent(s).  This can be done via a preliminary prompt like *"Classify the user's request and choose an appropriate agent"*.

* **Context cues:** Certain keywords or conversation context can trigger modes.  E.g. "Write a poem" → creative mode; "What is X?" → retrieval/coT mode; math equations → calculation agent.  Embedding such cues in the system prompt or a meta-instruction helps guide mode choice.

* **Dynamic chaining:** An agent can conclude "I need more information" or "this requires a creative approach" and hand off to another mode.  For instance, a ReAct agent that fails to find an answer might pass control to a verification or knowledge-retrieval agent.  In LangGraph-style designs, each agent returns a **Command** specifying the next agent and what data to pass.

* **Planner agent:** For complex queries, a dedicated Planner agent (possibly using an AutoGPT-style loop) can generate a plan of sub-steps and assign them to agents.  For example, given "Plan a trip," the planner breaks it into: (1) "Search flights" (Retrieval agent), (2) "Compare itineraries" (Analytic agent), (3) "Write an itinerary email" (Creative/Language agent).  This mirrors the **Agentic RAG** pattern: separate agents for Retrieval, Reasoning, and Generation working in concert.

**Table: Reasoning Modes & Activation**

| Mode                          | Description                                                 | Activation Trigger                                         | Next Step / Output                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retrieval (IR)**            | Fetches external info (docs, search, KB).                   | Factual questions, up-to-date info needed.                 | Return evidence snippets to reasoning agent.            |
| **CoT / Sequential**          | Chains logical steps in text (chain-of-thought).            | Multi-step reasoning (math, logic) or when clarity needed. | Detailed answer or sub-questions.                       |
| **ReAct (Tool-use)**          | Alternates reasoning and actions (tool calls).              | Tasks requiring tools (code execution, API call).          | Intermediate actions (e.g. run code) and thought steps. |
| **Creative / Generative**     | Storytelling, brainstorming, stylistic output.              | Non-factual, imaginative queries.                          | Creative narrative or idea generation.                  |
| **Symbolic (Logic)**          | Formal logic or rule-based inference (e.g. theorem prover). | Strict logical tasks, puzzle, formal reasoning.            | Verifiable logical conclusions.                         |
| **Verification / Fact-Check** | Check accuracy of answers (maybe using tools).              | When high accuracy needed or doubt flagged.                | Confirmed/rejected answers; corrections if needed.      |

## Passing Data Between Agents

Agents share data via an **internal state/memory** or via explicit **handoffs**. Two common patterns are:

* **Shared scratchpad:** All agents append to a common context log.  Every agent sees all prior reasoning steps and can build on them.  This maximizes transparency (each step is visible) but can become verbose.  Useful when full auditability is needed.

* **Independent scratchpads + merge:** Each agent works independently, writing its results to its own state.  Once an agent finishes, its output (answer, summary, data) is appended to a global context or handed to the next agent.  For example, Agent A writes "found X" to its local memory, then passes "X" to Agent B.  LangGraph implements this via **Command** objects: an agent returns `Command(goto=NextAgent, update={…})` to update shared state.

* **Memory systems:** Use a vector database or knowledge store for long-term and conversation memory.  All agents can read/write to this memory.  For instance, facts retrieved by the IR agent can be stored in memory and later re-used.  This ensures context continuity in multi-turn conversations.  The memory can also be semantic (embeddings) so agents can query "similar past events" from previous chats.

* **Tool-chain outputs:** When an agent calls a tool (search, calculator, code runner), its results feed back into its context.  The agent then decides the next mode based on that output.  For example, a ReAct agent might use a "search" tool, examine results, then decide whether to call a verification agent or proceed to answer generation.

## Frameworks & Tools

Several frameworks facilitate multi-agent orchestration:

* **LangChain:** A flexible open-source framework for chaining LLM calls with tools, memory, and logic.  Supports *Chains* (sequences of steps) and *Agents* (LLMs with tool access).  Memory modules maintain conversational context.  Good for custom pipelines and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  Developers write code (Python) to define prompts, tools (APIs, vector DBs, etc.), and chains.

* **LangGraph:** An extension for **graph-based workflows**.  Each agent is a node; edges define transitions and conditionals.  Supports loops, branches and explicit state management.  Ideal for complex multi-agent pipelines where you want fine-grained control over flow.  For example, a LangGraph graph can model a state machine where after each agent's step the next agent is chosen by conditions.

* **AutoGen (Microsoft):** A multi-agent collaboration SDK emphasizing conversation-driven workflows.  Agents can "delegate" tasks to each other and even interact with humans in the loop.  AutoGen provides ready patterns for agent dialogues and testing.  It shines for building teams of agents that converse with each other (or with humans) to solve tasks.

* **CrewAI:** A no-code/low-code platform for "teams" of agents.  Each agent has a role, goal, and toolset.  CrewAI's visual builder lets you configure agents and their interactions.  Good for enterprise settings where non-developers design agent workflows.  It treats agents almost like microservices, with defined inputs, outputs, and memory.

* **OpenAgents (XLang.ai):** Provides specialized agents (Data Agent, Plugins Agent, Web Agent) for common tasks.  It excels at data processing and web automation.  However, it currently lacks built-in multi-agent collaboration (agents don't easily hand off tasks).  It's more of a generalist toolkit than an orchestrator.

Each framework has trade-offs: for deep customization and open-source control, **LangChain/LangGraph** are powerful.  For high-level ease and built-in collaboration patterns, **AutoGen** or **CrewAI** can accelerate development.

## Hybrid Symbolic & Neural Methods

For robust reasoning, combine LLMs with symbolic or retrieval-based components:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Always augment answers with real data.  For factual queries, first retrieve relevant documents (via search or vector DB) and feed them into the LLM.  This grounds generation and can be done per-agent.  In Agentic RAG, separate agents handle "Retrieve" (search/KB lookup) and "Generate/Reason".

* **Knowledge Graphs / KBs:** Store key knowledge symbolically.  When needed, query a graph for precise facts and supply them as context.  For example, an agent might translate a question into a SPARQL/logic query against Wikidata, then incorporate the results.  This leverages LLMs' language strengths with the precision of structured data.

* **Logical Inference Engines:** For strict logic puzzles or formal reasoning, have the LLM output a formal representation (e.g. in first-order logic) and call an external solver (e.g. Z3, Prolog, Pyke).  The solver guarantees coherence, and returns a proof or answer.  This "LLM + symbolic solver" synergy ensures accuracy: the model handles natural language, the solver handles mathematics or logic.

* **Rule-based modules:** Implement deterministic checks (e.g. math calculation, regex matching) as tools.  An agent can choose a "calculator" or "date-formatter" tool when appropriate.  This combines the LLM's flexibility with precise rule execution.  (Many frameworks allow registering such functions as callable tools for agents.)

* **Plugin/Tool Ecosystem:** Leverage existing APIs and plugins (weather API, Wolfram Alpha, code execution).  ReAct agents can use tool calls as actions. For example, a "Math Agent" might call a Python REPL, while a "Web Agent" calls a browser tool.

Integrating these methods means designing the workflow so that a query might **flow between paradigms**. E.g., an LLM first reasons generally, then calls a KG agent to verify a fact, then passes that result back into the generation. The orchestrator must handle these transitions smoothly (see next section).

## Prompt Engineering & Control Flow

Careful prompt design and rules are key to fluid mode transitions:

* **Distinct System Prompts:** Give each agent a clear role in its system message.  Specify its persona, allowed tools, and style.  For example, a "Creative Agent" system prompt might say "You are a playful storyteller; use vivid imagery," while a "Research Agent" is "You are an analytical assistant who uses factual sources and code tools."  This primes each agent for its mode.

* **Contextualizing Mode Switches:** When handing off to a new agent or mode, summarize prior context in the new prompt.  For example, if switching from "fact-check" to "answer generation," include a brief summary of the evidence found.  The system message can also *explicitly* note the switch (e.g. "Now enter Creative mode based on above data").  Spreadsheet Surgeons notes that incorporating the context switch in the system message helps align the agent's perspective.

* **Step-by-step Guidance:** Encourage internal reasoning by instructing agents to think in steps.  Use chain-of-thought cues (e.g. "First, … then …"), or structural markers (ReAct style) like `[Thought]` and `[Action]` tokens.  In ReAct prompts, explicitly label reasoning vs action so the agent alternates properly.  This makes the flow between thinking and doing explicit.

* **Iteration Control:** Define stopping criteria.  For example, set a maximum number of turns or require a keyword (like "DONE") to finish.  Frameworks like CrewAI let you set `max_iter` for each agent.  Alternatively, include in the system prompt: "Stop when you have a complete answer."  This prevents runaway loops.

* **Memory and Long-Term Context:** Use prompts to retrieve relevant memory.  For example, at each user turn, prepend a memory summary (from vector DB) to the prompt.  This keeps the agent aware of long-term user data.  Some frameworks (LangChain) automate this with "retrieval memory" so that relevant past facts are injected before reasoning.

* **Fallbacks and Verification:** Include rules for uncertainty.  E.g. if an agent is unsure, instruct it to flag the answer or call a verification sub-agent.  For high-stakes queries, you might chain a "Verification Agent" whose prompt is "Verify the facts of the previous response and correct if needed."

* **Prompt Pipelines:** In code, define prompt templates for each mode and a router function.  For instance, a routing LLM could receive a system prompt listing available agents and choose by name:

  ```
  System: You are the Orchestrator. Available agents: [Creative, Retrieval, Math, FactCheck]. 
  Based on the query and context, respond with the name of the agent(s) to invoke and any sub-tasks.
  ```

  The output can be parsed (e.g. in JSON) to programmatically call the chosen agent.

By controlling prompts at each stage, you ensure smooth transitions.  Always make explicit what the agent's objective is, and reset or switch system instructions when the mode changes.  The combination of careful system messages and summarized context creates a fluid, context-aware conversation.

## Orchestration Strategies (Summary)

Combining all the above leads to a flexible, adaptive agent.  Here are key takeaways:

* **Modular Design:** Build a **Master Agent** that delegates to specialized sub-agents (tools). Use multi-agent patterns (supervisor, pipeline) to structure control flow.
* **Reasoning Modes:** Include a variety of modes (CoT, ReAct, creative, retrieval, logic) and dynamically select them.  Use LLM prompts or rules to activate modes based on input type and intermediate results.
* **Inter-Agent Communication:** Pass information via shared context or explicit state.  Shared scratchpads give transparency; independent scratchpads with merging keep agents decoupled.  Use memory databases for persistent state.
* **Frameworks:** Leverage existing libraries.  LangChain/LangGraph for custom orchestrations; AutoGen/CrewAI for managed multi-agent setups; specialized tools for specific reasoning tasks.
* **Symbolic Integration:** When needed, have agents call external solvers or KBs for precise logic.  Combine neural generation with deterministic computation or database queries for accuracy.
* **Prompt Rules:** Clearly define roles and transitions in prompts.  Maintain context continuity by summarizing when switching, and guide agents with structured reasoning cues.

By following this modular, agentic architecture with well-defined communication and prompts, your Discord AI bot can flexibly switch modes and maintain coherence.  The result is a **context-aware, adaptive agent** that "reasons out loud," delegates tasks intelligently, and provides powerful, fluid interaction.

**Sources:** Architectures and agent design patterns are described in recent literature and blogs on LLM agents.  Framework features and multi-agent strategies are documented by LangChain, Microsoft AutoGen, CrewAI, and others.  Techniques for hybrid reasoning draw on neuro-symbolic AI research and LLM tooling papers.
