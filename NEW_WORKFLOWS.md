## Workflow Detection

The system uses enhanced pattern recognition to detect which workflow is most appropriate:

```python
async def detect_workflow_type(self, query: str, conversation_id: str = None) -> str:
    # Check if we should use a pure reasoning approach first
    if self._should_use_pure_reasoning(query):
        return await self._detect_pure_reasoning_type(query)
    
    # Technical problem-solving
    if re.search(r'(solve|calculate|compute|equation|formula|differential|optimize|performance)', query, re.IGNORECASE):

def _should_use_pure_reasoning(self, query: str) -> bool:
    # Use pure reasoning for simple queries
    if len(query.split()) < 5:
        return True
        
    # Simple question words often indicate pure RAG
    if re.match(r'^(who|what|when|where)\s+.{1,15}\?$', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return True
        
    # Basic calculations indicate pure symbolic
    if re.match(r'^(calculate|compute)\s+[\d\+\-\*\/\^\(\)]{3,15}$', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return True
        
    # Simple creative requests
    if re.match(r'^(write|create|generate)\s+a\s+(short|quick|simple)\s+.{1,15}$', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return True
        
    return False
    
async def _detect_pure_reasoning_type(self, query: str) -> str:
    # Check for simple RAG queries
    if re.search(r'^(who|what|when|where|why)\s', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "rag_alone"

        return "verification_alone"
        
    # Default to RAG for simple queries
    return "rag_alone"
```

## Guidelines for Combining vs. Pure Reasoning

The system determines whether to use combined or pure reasoning based on:

### Combine When:
- Query contains multiple verbs ("Analyze and compare...")
- Contains uncertainty markers ("might", "could", "possibly")
- Asks for multiple perspectives
- Uses complex terminology from ≥2 domains
- Query length exceeds 15 words
- Specified complexity indicators present ("in-depth", "detailed", "comprehensive")

### Stay Pure When:
- Query is under 5 words
- Uses simple question words (Who/What/When)
- Requests basic calculations
- Asks for definitions
- Simple yes/no questions
- No qualifiers or complexity indicators

The optimal balance is using 2-3 reasoning types per query - enough for depth without unnecessary overhead.
