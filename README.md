- **Replies**: Reply to the bot's messages to continue conversations

The bot automatically detects the most appropriate reasoning mode based on your query:
- "What's the capital of France?" ‚Üí Conversational or RAG mode (simple factual query)
- "Explain how quantum computing works step by step" ‚Üí Sequential thinking mode (complex explanation)
- "Find recent information about climate change" ‚Üí RAG mode (information retrieval)
- "Verify if drinking 8 glasses of water daily is necessary" ‚Üí Verification mode (fact-checking)
- "Create a short story about a robot learning to paint" ‚Üí Creative mode (generative content)
- "Calculate the compound interest on $1000 at 5% for 5 years" ‚Üí Calculation mode (math)
- "Map the relationships between characters in Hamlet" ‚Üí Graph mode (relationship analysis)

## Multi-Agent Architecture

The Discord AI Chatbot uses a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that dynamically selects different reasoning approaches based on the query type:

### Agent Types

| Agent Type | Emoji | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Sequential | üîÑ | Step-by-step analytical thinking | Complex problems, detailed analysis |
| RAG | üìö | Retrieval-Augmented Generation | Information seeking, fact-based queries |
| Conversational | üí¨ | Natural, friendly dialogue | Casual chat, simple exchanges |
| Knowledge | üìö | Detailed educational content | Learning, concept explanation |
| Verification | ‚úÖ | Fact-checking and validation | Claims evaluation, truth assessment |
| Creative | üé® | Imaginative content generation | Stories, art, creative writing |
| Calculation | üßÆ | Mathematical operations | Computations, numerical analysis |
| Planning | üìã | Structured strategy development | Project plans, task organization |
| Graph | üìä | Relationship mapping | Concept networks, interconnections |
| Multi-Agent | üë• | Multiple perspectives | Balanced viewpoints, debates |

### How It Works

The bot uses a sophisticated orchestration system to determine the most appropriate reasoning method for each query:

1. **Automatic Intent Detection**: When you send a message, the bot analyzes your query using natural language understanding to determine what you're asking for:
   - Questions about facts or recent information trigger the RAG system
   - Step-by-step requests activate Sequential reasoning
   - Creative requests like stories or poems use Creative mode
   - Mathematical questions route to the Calculation agent
   - Multiple-perspective requests engage the Multi-agent workflow

2. **Smart Context Analysis**: Beyond keywords, the bot examines:
   - Complexity of the question (simple ‚Üí Conversational, complex ‚Üí Sequential)
   - Question patterns (who/what/when ‚Üí RAG, how/why ‚Üí Sequential)
   - Specific verbs ("verify," "calculate," "create," "explain," "map")
   - Request structure (step-by-step indicators, fact-checking cues)

3. **Dynamic Reasoning Selection**: The bot doesn't just use one reasoning mode:
   - It may combine multiple reasoning types for complex queries
   - For example: "Research recent advances in AI and analyze their potential impacts step by step" 
     would combine RAG (for research) with Sequential (for step-by-step analysis)
   - The reasoning icon (emoji) shows which mode is being used

4. **User Preference Adaptation**: Your settings and history influence mode selection:
   - If you've set a preferred reasoning mode, the bot prioritizes it
   - The bot learns from your interactions and adjusts over time
   - You can override automatic selection for any specific query

5. **Workflow Orchestration**: For complex multi-step queries, the bot may activate workflow mode:
   - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks
   - Routes each sub-task to the appropriate specialized agent
   - Maintains a shared state to pass information between agents
   - Synthesizes all agent outputs into a cohesive response

This autonomous selection happens behind the scenes - you don't need to specify reasoning modes unless you want to override the bot's choices.

### Workflow Mode

For advanced users, the bot supports a workflow mode that uses LangGraph to orchestrate complex reasoning flows:

1. **Workflow Activation**: Enable with `Enable workflow mode` or through user preferences.
   
2. **Graph-Based Reasoning**: The workflow mode creates a directed graph of reasoning steps, where each node represents an agent or processing step.
   
3. **State Management**: LangGraph maintains a shared state object that passes information between agents, allowing for explicit control over the reasoning flow.
   
4. **Complex Multi-Step Processing**:
   - For example, a research query might flow through: Query Analysis ‚Üí RAG Retrieval ‚Üí Information Verification ‚Üí Sequential Synthesis ‚Üí Final Response.
   - Each step can use a different specialized agent optimized for that task.
   
5. **Fallback Logic**: The workflow includes graceful error handling with fallback paths if a particular reasoning approach fails.

6. **Tools Integration**: Specialized tools like web search, calculators, and memory retrieval are integrated into the workflow as needed.

7. **Installation**: Workflow mode requires LangGraph to be installed (`pip install langgraph`).

## Emoji Reactions

The bot uses emoji reactions to indicate which reasoning type is being used:

| Emoji | Reasoning Type | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| üîÑ | Sequential | Step-by-step analytical thinking |
| üìö | RAG | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (information lookup) |
| üí¨ | Conversational | Natural dialogue mode |
| ‚úÖ | Verification | Fact-checking and validation |
| üé® | Creative | Imaginative content generation |
| üßÆ | Calculation | Mathematical operations |
| üìä | Graph | Relationship mapping and analysis |
| üë• | Multi-Agent | Multiple specialized approaches |
| üìã | Planning | Structured strategy development |
| üîç | Step-Back | Big-picture perspective |
| ‚õìÔ∏è | Chain-of-Thought | Logical progression |
| üîÑ | ReAct | Reasoning with actions |

## Core Capabilities

The Discord AI Chatbot combines several advanced capabilities:

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
The bot uses an orchestration system to coordinate different specialized agents, selecting the most appropriate reasoning approach for each query.

### 2. Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Reasoning
For mathematical and logical operations, the bot combines neural language models with deterministic symbolic reasoning for increased accuracy.

### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture
The codebase uses a modular service architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

### 4. Memory Management
A sophisticated memory system tracks conversation history, user preferences, and agent scratchpads.

### 5. Tool Integration
Agents can use various tools including web search, calculators, and knowledge bases to enhance their capabilities.

## Service Architecture

The bot is built on a service-oriented architecture with these key services:

1. **agent_service**: Core orchestration and reasoning type detection
2. **memory_service**: Conversation history and user preferences
3. **message_service**: Message formatting and processing
4. **workflow_service**: Graph-based reasoning workflows
5. **symbolic_reasoning_service**: Deterministic operations

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Reasoning Approaches
You can explicitly request multiple reasoning types together:

```
@BotName search for recent information about quantum computing and then verify the key claims
```

This combines RAG (search) with verification reasoning.

### Accessing Specialized Tools
Certain phrases trigger specialized tool usage:

```
@BotName calculate the derivative of 3x^2 + 2x with respect to x
```

This triggers the symbolic math calculator for precise mathematical operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
- Check if the bot has the correct permissions in your server
- Verify that your API keys are correctly set in the .env file
- Check if the bot is active in the current channel

### Incorrect Reasoning Type
- Be more explicit in your query about the type of reasoning you need
- Use clear trigger phrases like "think step by step" or "search for information about"
- Set your default reasoning preference using `set my reasoning mode to [type]`

### Memory Issues
- If the bot seems to forget context, try using `reset conversation` to start fresh
- For persistent issues, check the bot's logs for memory-related errors
