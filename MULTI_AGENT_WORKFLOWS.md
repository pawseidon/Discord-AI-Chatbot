## Workflow Detection

The system uses enhanced pattern recognition to detect which workflow is most appropriate:

```python
async def detect_workflow_type(self, query: str, conversation_id: str = None) -> str:
    # Check if we should use a pure reasoning approach first
    if self._should_use_pure_reasoning(query):
        return await self._detect_pure_reasoning_type(query)
    
    # Technical problem-solving
    if re.search(r'(solve|calculate|compute|equation|formula|differential|optimize|performance)', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        if re.search(r'(technical|stem|math|engineering|science|database|code|algorithm)', query, re.IGNORECASE):
            return "technical_problem"
    
    # Educational explanations
    educational_pattern = r'(explain|how does|step[s]?[ -]by[ -]step|detail|describe|define)'
    factual_pattern = r'(what is|what are|who was|when did|where is)'
    if re.search(educational_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE) or re.search(factual_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "educational_explanations"
    
    # Knowledge synthesis (NEW)
    knowledge_pattern = r'(comprehensive|complete|knowledge map|deeply understand|synthesis|integrate|connect knowledge)'
    if re.search(knowledge_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "knowledge_synthesis"
    
    # Analytical problem-solving (NEW)
    analytical_pattern = r'(analyze problem|debug|troubleshoot|find issue|diagnose|root cause|examine in detail)'

        return "analytical_problem_solving"
    
    # Fact-checking & verification
    factual_verification_pattern = r'(verify|fact.?check|is it true|confirm|evidence|source|accuracy|reliable)'
    if re.search(factual_verification_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "fact_checking"
    
    # Creative development
    creative_pattern = r'(write|create|generate|story|poem|design|imagine|fiction|creative)'
    if re.search(creative_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        if re.search(r'(structure|organized|coherent|step|sequence|framework)', query, re.IGNORECASE):
            return "creative_development"
        return "creative_alone"  # Pure creative if no structure requested
    
    # Controversial topic analysis
    controversial_pattern = r'(debate|ethics|perspective|viewpoint|pros.and.cons|trade.?offs|argument)'
    if re.search(controversial_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "controversial_topics"
    
    # Strategic planning
    planning_pattern = r'(plan|strategy|roadmap|project|timeline|steps for|how to implement|approach to)'
    if re.search(planning_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "strategic_planning"
    
    # Relationship analysis
    relationship_pattern = r'(relationship|network|connect|connection|between|map|diagram|influence)'
    if re.search(relationship_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "relationship_analysis"

    if re.search(innovation_pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return "cross_domain_innovation"
    
    # Default to educational explanations as a safe fallback
    return "educational_explanations"
```

## Guidelines for Combining vs. Pure Reasoning

The system determines whether to use combined or pure reasoning based on:

### Combine When:
- Query contains multiple verbs ("Analyze and compare...")
- Contains uncertainty markers ("might", "could", "possibly")
- Asks for multiple perspectives
- Uses complex terminology from ≥2 domains
- Query length exceeds 15 words
- Specified complexity indicators present ("in-depth", "detailed", "comprehensive")

### Stay Pure When:
- Query is under 5 words
- Uses simple question words (Who/What/When)
- Requests basic calculations
- Asks for definitions
- Simple yes/no questions
- No qualifiers or complexity indicators

The optimal balance is using 2-3 reasoning types per query - enough for depth without unnecessary overhead.
