### Pure Single-Reasoning Use Cases

For simpler queries, the system uses a single reasoning type:

| Mode | Emoji | Use Case | Example | Dynamic Flow |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| RAG Alone | üìö | Simple facts, current information | "What is the capital of France?" | üîÑ‚Üíüìö‚Üíüìù |

| Verification Alone | ‚úÖ | Quick fact checks | "Is water H2O?" | üîÑ‚Üí‚úÖ‚Üíüìù |
| Sequential Alone | üîÑ | Step-by-step tutorials | "How do I bake a cake?" | üîÑ‚Üíüîç‚Üíüß©‚Üíüìã‚Üíüìù |

Thoughts stay visible to the user throughout the reasoning process, including any revisions or modifications to earlier steps.

### How It Works

The bot uses a sophisticated orchestration system to determine the most appropriate reasoning method for each query:

1. **Automatic Intent Detection**: When you send a message, the bot analyzes your query using natural language understanding to determine what you're asking for:
   - Questions about facts or recent information trigger the RAG system
   - Step-by-step requests activate Sequential reasoning
   - Creative requests like stories or poems use Creative mode
   - Mathematical questions route to the Calculation agent
   - Multiple-perspective requests engage the Multi-agent workflow
   - Deep understanding requests activate Knowledge Synthesis
   - Debugging and diagnosis requests use Analytical Problem-Solving

2. **Smart Context Analysis**: Beyond keywords, the bot examines:
   - Complexity of the question (simple ‚Üí single reasoning, complex ‚Üí workflow combinations)
   - Question patterns (who/what/when ‚Üí RAG, how/why ‚Üí Sequential)
   - Specific verbs ("verify," "calculate," "create," "explain," "map," "debug," "synthesize")
   - Request structure and context markers

3. **Dynamic Reasoning Selection**: The bot doesn't just use one reasoning mode:
   - For complex queries, it selects an optimized workflow combination
   - For example: "Explain how quantum computing works step-by-step" triggers the Educational Explanations workflow
   - The emoji sequence shows which reasoning types are being used in order

4. **User Preference Adaptation**: Your settings and history influence mode selection:
   - If you've set a preferred reasoning mode, the bot prioritizes it
   - The bot learns from your interactions and adjusts over time
   - You can override automatic selection for any specific query

5. **Workflow Orchestration**: For complex multi-step queries, the bot activates the appropriate workflow:
   - Each workflow follows a specific reasoning sequence optimized for the query type
   - Individual reasoning agents contribute their specialized capabilities
   - The system maintains transitions between reasoning phases with visual indicators
   - Outputs are synthesized into a cohesive response

This autonomous selection happens behind the scenes - you don't need to specify reasoning modes unless you want to override the bot's choices.

### Enhanced Sequential Reasoning Visualization

For sequential reasoning, each step is clearly marked with dynamic emoji indicators:

```
üîÑ **Sequential Reasoning Initiated**

üîç **Step 1**: [Understanding the problem]
[Detailed breakdown of the problem]

üß© **Step 2**: [Breaking down components]
[Analysis of key components]

üìã **Step 3**: [Organizing information]
[Structured organization of relevant data]

üîé **Step 4**: [Detailed analysis]
[In-depth examination of each aspect]

üß† **Step 5**: [Applying principles]
[Application of relevant concepts/theories]

üìù **Working Memory**: [Key points to remember]

```

For complex reasoning, additional indicators highlight specific cognitive functions:

- üí° **Insight**: [New realization]
- üîÄ **Alternative Path**: [Different approach]
- üîÑ **Recursive Analysis**: [Deeper iteration]
- üåê **Broader Context**: [Zooming out]
- üî¨ **Detailed Focus**: [Zooming in]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issue**: [Problem identification]
- üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Approach**: [Fixing identified issue]

This structured formatting helps you follow the bot's reasoning process clearly from start to finish. All thoughts remain visible throughout the process, allowing you to track the evolution of reasoning, including any revisions to earlier steps.

### Workflow Mode

For advanced users, the bot supports a workflow mode that uses LangGraph to orchestrate complex reasoning flows:

1. **Workflow Activation**: Enable with `Enable workflow mode` or through user preferences.
   
2. **Graph-Based Reasoning**: The workflow mode creates a directed graph of reasoning steps, where each node represents an agent or processing step.
   
3. **State Management**: LangGraph maintains a shared state object that passes information between agents, allowing for explicit control over the reasoning flow.
   
4. **Complex Multi-Step Processing**:
   - For example, a research query might flow through: Query Analysis ‚Üí RAG Retrieval ‚Üí Information Verification ‚Üí Sequential Synthesis ‚Üí Final Response.
   - Each step can use a different specialized agent optimized for that task.
   
5. **Fallback Logic**: The workflow includes graceful error handling with fallback paths if a particular reasoning approach fails.

6. **Tools Integration**: Specialized tools like web search, calculators, and memory retrieval are integrated into the workflow as needed.

7. **Installation**: Workflow mode requires LangGraph to be installed (`pip install langgraph`).

### **When to Combine vs Go Pure**
**Combine When:**  
- Query contains multiple verbs ("Analyze and compare...")  
- Contains uncertainty markers ("might", "could", "possibly")  
- Asks for multiple perspectives  
- Uses complex terminology from ‚â•2 domains  

**Stay Pure When:**  
- Query is under 5 words  
- Uses simple question words (Who/What/When)  
- Requests basic calculations  
- Asks for definitions  

This framework maintains speed for simple queries while leveraging combinatorial power for complex tasks. The sweet spot is 2-3 reasoning types per query - enough for depth without unnecessary overhead.
