  - `cogs/commands_cogs/ReflectiveRAGCog.py` (removed reflective RAG)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/AiStuffCog.py` (removed image generation commands)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/ImageCog.py` (removed image analysis and generation)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/MCPAgentCog.py` (functionality duplicated in ReasoningCog)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/StatsCog.py` (not in active cogs list)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/KnowledgeBaseCog.py` (functionality handled by agent_service RAG)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/AgentCog.py` (functionality duplicated in ReasoningCog)
  - `cogs/commands_cogs/CleanupCog.py` (not essential for core functionality)

- **Documentation**:
  - `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` (consolidated into CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)
  - `CODE_CLEANUP.md` (consolidated into CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)
  - `README_UPDATE.md` (merged into README.md)
  - `CODE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (consolidated into CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)

- **Test Scripts**:
  - `test_mcp.py` (removed as it depended on deleted mcp_utils.py)

### 6. Module Migration Progress
- All utility modules have been migrated to service architecture
- Command cogs updated to use services directly
- Event handlers using service layer properly
- Test scripts updated to use service architecture
- Enhanced message_service with code formatting and content type detection
- Removed image, voice and sentiment functionality from on_message.py and intent_detection service
- Streamlined cogs to only include essential functionality

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all services
- Create integration tests for service interactions
- Add performance benchmarks to verify optimization

### 2. Documentation
- Update code comments and docstrings
- Create developer documentation for service usage
- Add examples of extending the service architecture

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement consistent error handling across services
- Add graceful fallback mechanisms
- Improve error reporting and logging

## Service Architecture

The codebase now follows a consistent service-oriented architecture with these primary services:

1. **agent_service**: Central service for AI agent functionality
   - Handles different reasoning types
   - Manages agent orchestration and tool usage
   - Provides unified interface for AI operations

2. **memory_service**: Manages conversation history and user preferences
   - Handles data persistence
   - Provides memory summarization
   - Manages user settings and preferences

3. **message_service**: Formats and handles message processing
   - Provides consistent message formatting
   - Handles chunking and splitting of messages
   - Manages response formatting for different contexts
   - Provides code formatting and content type detection
   - Creates appropriate message embeds based on content

4. **workflow_service**: Manages complex agent workflows
   - Orchestrates multi-step agent processes
   - Handles task routing and delegation
   - Manages workflow state and context

5. **symbolic_reasoning_service**: Handles specialized reasoning
   - Provides formal reasoning capabilities
   - Manages mathematical operations
   - Supports logical validation and verification

## Conclusion

The codebase is now significantly more maintainable with reduced duplication and proper separation of concerns. All core functionalities are now handled through dedicated services with clean interfaces and proper dependency management. Non-essential features have been removed to focus on a streamlined, core conversational AI experience with advanced reasoning capabilities. The codebase now only includes the essential cogs (ReasoningCog and HelpCog) and retains all the critical reasoning functionality including RAG, sequential thinking, and graph of thoughts.
